# SymSafe: Clinical-Aware AI Symptom Screener

**SymSafe** is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates how AI-powered agents can safely assist with early symptom screening while staying aligned with clinical, ethical, and empathetic standards.

This is not a diagnostic tool ‚Äî it's a blueprint for building LLM-based agents in healthcare that prioritize:
- **Clinical escalation triggers**
- **Tone and empathy alignment**
- **PHI handling awareness**
- **Safety guardrails**

## üí° Why This Exists

Most "AI symptom checkers" are demo toys. This project simulates a system you'd actually want a **healthcare AI leader** to greenlight ‚Äî with emphasis on *productization*, *compliance*, and *real-world UX concerns*.

## üîç Core Capabilities

- Accepts natural language symptom input from user
- Uses GPT-4 or Claude to analyze for urgency triggers
- Returns a response tailored by:
  - Tone (calm, helpful, not alarming)
  - Suggestive care (never diagnostic)
  - Escalation if urgent keywords are detected
- Evaluation framework flags hallucinations, dangerous advice, or overly generic responses
